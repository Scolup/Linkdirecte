## 🚀 Getting started

For development, **Bun is required**.

1. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Clone the repo
```bash
gh repo clone Scolup/Linkdirecte
```
2. ⬇️ Install deps
```bash
bun install
```
3. ⛏️ Start working!

## 🗂️ Project structure

```
src/
├── auth/       # Login, token management, 2FA
├── core/       # Shared HTTP client, session handling
├── modules/    # API endpoints (grades, absences, etc.)
└── types/      # TypeScript type definitions
tests/          # Bun test files
wiki/           # Documentation (auto-published to gh wiki on push)
```

## 🧪 Running tests

```bash
bun test
```

Tests live in `tests/` and use Bun's built-in test runner. If you're adding a new feature or fixing a bug, add or update tests where relevant.

## 📏 Rules

* At every production commit (this means before a PR is merged or in a commit directly pushed to main), **run `bun precommit`**. This will run checks and format with oxfmt.
* When making a commit, follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). When making a new branch, follow [conventional branch](https://conventionalbranch.org).
* If you're working on a big or breaking change, discuss it in an issue with the admins before opening a PR, and link that issue in your PR.
* To work on Linkdirecte, _fork the project_ and target your PR to either `main` or another official branch.
* Versioning is managed only by the project admins. Please do not change it directly.
* **NEVER** manually publish to npm (except if the GitHub workflow doesn't work and the release can't wait to be published).
* Update the docs in the [wiki](wiki/) folder if needed.

## 🤖 Developing with AI

Working with AI is something we **totally accept**, but to these conditions :
* You are honest and *do not* lie when we ask if your work has been partially or fully vibe-coded
* You are **capable of explaining your changes**

We already wrote resources specifically for agents so they understand the codebase and know how to work with it.
